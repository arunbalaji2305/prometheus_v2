CPU by core
Average CPU by core
Maximum CPU
```

### 🧠 Memory Queries
```
memory

Memory in gigabytes
Memory in GB
Memory used
```

### 🌐 Network Queries
```
network
Network speed
Network traffic
Network by interface

Average network traffic
```

### 💾 Disk Queries
```
disk
Disk activity
Disk I/O
Disk for last 30 minutes
Disk by volume

```

### 📊 Advanced Queries
```
Maximum CPU by core
Peak network traffic by interface
Total disk I/O for last hour
Memory used in gigabytes
CPU above 80 percent
Network traffic over 1MB
Average disk by volume for last 2 hours
```

## ⏱️ Time Ranges

Add these to any query:
- `for last 5 minutes`
- `for last 15 minutes`
- `for last 30 minutes`
- `for last hour`
- `for last 2 hours`
- `last day`

## 🔧 Grouping

Add these to any query:
- `by core` (CPU)
- `by interface` (Network)
- `by volume` (Disk)
- `per drive` (Disk)

## 📐 Units

Convert to different units:
- `in gigabytes` or `in GB`
- `in megabytes` or `in MB`
- `in kilobytes` or `in KB`

## 📈 Statistics

Get aggregated values:
- `maximum`
- `minimum`
- `average`
- `total`
- `peak`

## 🎯 Quick Tips

1. **Keep it simple:** "CPU" works just as well as "Show me the CPU usage"
2. **Be flexible:** "Network speed" = "Network traffic" = "Network bandwidth"
3. **Combine concepts:** "Maximum CPU by core for last hour"
4. **Natural language:** "What's my memory doing?" works!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| No results | Metric might not exist, try simpler query |
| Syntax error | Try rephrasing or use demo queries |
| Timeout | Reduce time range or simplify query |
